          "question": "I like to code and stream it to have audience, is it weakness ? Because probably nobody will want to watch it so depending on it is a bad idea.",
          "answer": "Enjoying coding and streaming it can be a great way to share your passion and connect with others who have similar interests. It's not a weakness, but it's important to set realistic expectations. Here's a simple approach to consider:\n\n1. **Passion and Learning**: Focus on your love for coding and the learning process. Share your enthusiasm, and your passion will naturally attract like-minded viewers.\n\n2. **Start Small**: Don't worry too much about the audience size initially. Begin streaming for the joy of it, and as you gain experience and improve your content, your audience may grow.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Be consistent with your streaming schedule. Regular streams, even if they start small, can help build a loyal audience over time.\n\n4. **Engage with Viewers**: Interact with your viewers during your streams. Answer their questions, ask for feedback, and create a sense of community.\n\n5. **Improve Over Time**: Continuously work on improving your streaming skills, technical setup, and content quality. Learn from others and iterate based on feedback.\n\n6. **Don't Rely Solely on Streaming**: While streaming can be enjoyable, it's wise not to rely solely on it for income. Most successful streamers have multiple revenue streams, such as sponsorships, merchandise, or a day job.\n\n7. **Stay Realistic**: Not everyone will become a famous streamer, and that's okay. Enjoy the process, make friends with similar interests, and use it as a platform for self-expression.\n\nRemember, the key is to enjoy what you're doing. If you have fun coding and sharing it with others, then it's a worthwhile endeavor regardless of the audience size.
