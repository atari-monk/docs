          "answer": "To create a numbered or bulleted list in Markdown, you can follow these simple formatting rules:\n\n1. **Ordered (Numbered) List:**\n\n   To create an ordered (numbered) list, simply start each line with a number followed by a period and a space. For example:\n\n   ```markdown\n   1. First item\n   2. Second item\n   3. Third item\n   ```\n\n   This will render as:\n\n   1. First item\n   2. Second item\n   3. Third item\n\n2. **Unordered (Bulleted) List:**\n\n   To create an unordered (bulleted) list, begin each line with an asterisk (*), plus (+), or a minus (-) sign, followed by a space. For example:\n\n   ```markdown\n   * First item\n   * Second item\n   * Third item\n   ```\n\n   This will display as:\n\n   * First item\n   * Second item\n   * Third item\n\nRemember to include a space after the asterisk, plus, or minus sign to properly format the list.\n\nThat's it! Markdown will automatically format the list items for you.",

          "indexTitle": "Links",
          "question": "Links",
          "answer": "In Markdown, creating links is quite simple. You can use the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n[Link Text](URL)\n```\n\nHere, `Link Text` is the text you want to display for the link, and `URL` is the actual web address or link you want to point to. For example:\n\n```markdown\n[Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)\n```\n\nThis will create a link that, when clicked, directs the user to the OpenAI website, and the text \"Visit OpenAI\" will be the clickable link.\n\nIf you're working with a Markdown library in a programming language, you would use this syntax within the context of that language. For example, in Python using the `markdown` library:\n\n```python\nimport markdown\n\ntext = \"[Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)\"\nhtml = markdown.markdown(text)\nprint(html)\n```\n\nThis will convert the Markdown text to HTML, and you can then use or display the HTML as needed.\n\nKeep in mind that the exact implementation may vary depending on the Markdown library you are using, so be sure to check the documentation for the specific library you have in mind.",

          "question": "Image",
          "answer": "To include an image using the `markdown-it` library in TypeScript, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Dependencies:**\n   Make sure you have `markdown-it` and `markdown-it-implicit-figures` installed.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install markdown-it markdown-it-implicit-figures\n   ```\n\n2. **Import and Configure:**\n   Import the necessary modules and configure `markdown-it` to use `markdown-it-implicit-figures`.\n\n   ```typescript\n   import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it';\n   import implicitFigures from 'markdown-it-implicit-figures';\n\n   const md = MarkdownIt().use(implicitFigures, { dataType: false, figcaption: true });\n   ```\n\n3. **Write Markdown with Image:**\n   In your Markdown content, use the following syntax to include an image:\n\n   ```markdown\n   ![Alt Text](path/to/your/image.jpg)\n   ```\n\n4. **Render Markdown:**\n   Render your Markdown content using the configured `markdown-it` instance.\n\n   ```typescript\n   const markdownContent = `![Alt Text](path/to/your/image.jpg)`;\n   const htmlOutput = md.render(markdownContent);\n   ```\n\n   Now, `htmlOutput` contains the HTML with the image tag.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```typescript\nimport MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it';\nimport implicitFigures from 'markdown-it-implicit-figures';\n\nconst md = MarkdownIt().use(implicitFigures, { dataType: false, figcaption: true });\n\nconst markdownContent = `![Alt Text](path/to/your/image.jpg)`;\nconst htmlOutput = md.render(markdownContent);\n\nconsole.log(htmlOutput);\n```\n\nReplace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image. This is a basic setup for adding images to your Markdown using `markdown-it` in TypeScript. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific requirements or the structure of your project.  \n\nIt seems that there are no TypeScript declaration files (`@types/markdown-it-implicit-figures`) available on the npm registry for the `markdown-it-implicit-figures` package. In such cases, you can create a declaration file manually.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Declaration File:**\n   In your project, create a new file named `markdown-it-implicit-figures.d.ts`. This file will contain the declarations for the module.\n\n   ```typescript\n   // markdown-it-implicit-figures.d.ts\n   declare module 'markdown-it-implicit-figures';\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Declaration File:**\n   In your TypeScript code, import the module as you normally would.\n\n   ```typescript\n   import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it';\n   import implicitFigures from 'markdown-it-implicit-figures';\n\n   // Import the declaration file\n   import 'path/to/markdown-it-implicit-figures.d.ts';\n\n   const md = MarkdownIt().use(implicitFigures, { dataType: false, figcaption: true });\n\n   const markdownContent = `![Alt Text](path/to/your/image.jpg)`;\n   const htmlOutput = md.render(markdownContent);\n\n   console.log(htmlOutput);\n   ```\n\nMake sure to replace `'path/to/markdown-it-implicit-figures.d.ts'` with the actual path to your manually created declaration file.\n\nThis way, you can proceed without having the `@types/markdown-it-implicit-figures` package. This approach is suitable for cases where the TypeScript type definitions are not available through the `@types` scope on npm.  \n\nNote: In web development, it's recommended to use relative paths or URLs for images instead of absolute file paths. Absolute file paths might not work in all environments, especially when sharing or deploying your content.",
