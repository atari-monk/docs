          "question": "Whats better for **card game**, html canvas or just use html and css ?",
          "answer": "For a simple card game, using HTML and CSS alone might be the simplest solution. You can create the card layout and design using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. This approach is suitable if your card game doesn't require complex interactions or dynamic graphics.\n\nHowever, if your card game involves more interactivity, animations, or complex graphics, incorporating HTML canvas might be beneficial. HTML canvas allows you to draw and manipulate graphics dynamically using JavaScript. It provides more flexibility for creating interactive elements and animations.\n\nIn summary:\n- Use HTML and CSS for a simple card game with static content and minimal interactivity.\n- Integrate HTML canvas if your card game requires dynamic graphics, animations, or more complex interactions.",
