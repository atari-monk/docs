          "question": "Is music improving attention to coding or not ?",
          "answer": "Listening to music while coding can have both positive and negative effects on attention and productivity, and the impact can vary from person to person. Here are some key points to consider for a simple solution:\n\n**Positive Effects**:\n1. **Mood Enhancement**: Music can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed, which can boost your overall attention and focus.\n\n2. **Background Noise**: Some people find that a low to moderate level of background music can help drown out distracting noises in their environment, making it easier to concentrate.\n\n3. **Repetitive Tasks**: For repetitive or mundane coding tasks, music can provide a sense of rhythm and motivation that helps you stay on track.\n\n**Negative Effects**:\n1. **Distraction**: Complex or lyrical music can be distracting and reduce your ability to concentrate on intricate coding problems. \n\n2. **Multitasking**: Listening to music may lead to multitasking, as you may be tempted to adjust the playlist or skip songs, which can disrupt your workflow.\n\n3. **Lack of Silence**: Some coding tasks require deep concentration, and the presence of any background noise, including music, may hinder your ability to think deeply.\n\n**Simple Solution**: \nIf you want to use music to enhance your coding focus, consider the following simple guidelines:\n\n1. **Choose Instrumental Music**: Opt for instrumental music, such as classical, ambient, or electronic, as they often have fewer distractions (like lyrics).\n\n2. **Low Volume**: Keep the volume at a moderate or low level so that it remains in the background without overwhelming your thoughts.\n\n3. **Create a Playlist**: Prepare a playlist in advance to minimize the need for constant song selection.\n\n4. **Experiment**: Try coding with and without music to see which works best for you, as individual preferences vary.\n\nRemember that the impact of music on coding attention can differ between individuals, so it's important to find what works best for you and the specific coding tasks you're working on.",

          "question": "Does making notes make sense? ",
          "answer": "* Yes, making notes can be a helpful way to remember and organize information. It's a simple and effective way to retain important details.\n- Yes, I have such a project but i think spending to much time on them doesn't make sense\n* You're right, spending too much time on note-taking can be counterproductive. Try to keep your notes concise and focus on key points to save time while still benefiting from the process.\n- Taking notes dosent count as coding time? \n* Taking notes is not considered direct coding time, but it can be a valuable part of your coding workflow. It helps with planning, documentation, and understanding the code, which can ultimately save time in the long run. So, while it's not coding itself, it's a useful complementary activity.",
