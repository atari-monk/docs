Here's a simple pancake recipe for you:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 2 tablespoons sugar\n- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1 cup milk\n- 1 egg\n- 2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil\n- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n- Butter or oil for cooking\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n\n2. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract if using.\n\n3. **Combine Wet and Dry:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps; overmixing can make the pancakes tough.\n\n4. **Preheat Griddle or Pan:** Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. You can add a small amount of butter or oil to grease the surface if needed.\n\n5. **Cook the Pancakes:** Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, usually around 2-3 minutes.\n\n6. **Flip and Cook:** Flip the pancake and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes or until it's golden brown.\n\n7. **Serve:** Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, chocolate chips, or whipped cream.\n\nEnjoy your homemade pancakes!\n";
