Could not focus so used desperete method of bad notes:
1. decided to copy state api to client and game (server), becouse
it dosent matter if its shared or not at this point, what matters is i make this 
feature at last
2. Moved player state enum type to shared-api and include shared-api in game-api and client-api now
3. looking at changes 
shared-api:
removed libs
this is root
include in evry package
add PlayerState Type
game-api:
removed PlayerState Type
client-api:
removed PlayerState Type
add socket event handler
client:
add state to player 
set to idle
reccive state from server
create player type and use it
