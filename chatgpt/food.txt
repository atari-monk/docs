Can potatoes survive in storage for winter? 
ChatGPT
Yes, potatoes can survive in storage for the winter. To keep them fresh, store them in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated place, ideally between 45-50°F (7-10°C). This will help prevent sprouting and keep them from rotting. You can use a cellar, basement, or a cool cupboard for this purpose. Just make sure to check them periodically for any signs of spoilage.

Polish 
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. In that case, a "cool cupboard" in Polish would be referred to as a "spiżarnia," which is a storage area, often cool and dark, where you can store items like potatoes or other food for the winter. It serves a similar purpose as the English term "pantry."

Can i keep them in plastic bucket or better in air permissible sack? 
ChatGPT
It's better to store potatoes in an air-permeable sack or container rather than a plastic bucket. Potatoes need good ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to rot. Air-permeable sacks or containers allow for better airflow and can help extend their storage life. Additionally, storing them in a dark place will help prevent them from turning green due to exposure to light.

Place them on ground or lift them on hook in the sack? 
ChatGPT
It's advisable to place potatoes in the sack or container on the ground rather than hanging them on a hook. Placing them on the ground provides stability and reduces the risk of the sack falling or spilling. Just ensure that the storage area is cool, dark, and well-ventilated to maintain the quality of the potatoes throughout the winter.

Can i place one sack on another on a shelf? 
ChatGPT
Yes, you can place one sack of potatoes on top of another on a shelf as long as the shelf can support the weight. Be sure to arrange them so that there's good airflow between the sacks to prevent moisture buildup. This can help you maximize your storage space while keeping the potatoes in good condition for the winter.

How many kg can a backpack hold? Of potatoes? 
ChatGPT
The weight a backpack can hold depends on its size, design, and the materials it's made from. Generally, a standard-sized backpack can hold anywhere from 5 to 15 kilograms (11 to 33 pounds) of potatoes, depending on its capacity and the strength of its straps and seams. It's essential to check the specific weight capacity mentioned by the manufacturer for your backpack to ensure safe and comfortable use. Overloading a backpack can strain the straps and lead to discomfort or damage.

My plum jam turned out not very thick will i be able to use it? 
ChatGPT

2 / 2

If your plum jam turned out thinner than expected, you can still use it. There are a few options:

Re-cook: You can try re-cooking the jam to thicken it. Simmer it on low heat while stirring frequently until it reaches your desired thickness. Be patient and cautious not to scorch it.

Pectin: Adding commercial pectin can help thicken your jam. Follow the instructions on the pectin package for the correct amount to use.

Refrigerate: If re-cooking or adding pectin isn't an option, you can simply refrigerate the jam. It might not be as thick as you hoped, but it can still be used as a sauce or topping.

Mix with other fruit: You could mix your thin plum jam with other fruits or ingredients to create a new spread or sauce.

Remember to store the jam properly in clean, airtight containers in the refrigerator if it's not thickened to your liking.

It's not very thick but I pasteurized it, will it hold? It has sugar 
ChatGPT
If you pasteurized your plum jam and it contains sugar, it should have an extended shelf life and be safe to consume even if it's not very thick. The sugar acts as a natural preservative, helping to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. However, since it's not as thick as you'd like, consider using it relatively soon, as thinner jams may not have as long a shelf life as thicker ones. Store it in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator to help maintain its quality.
