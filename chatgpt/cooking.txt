ChatGPT
For a simple plum jam without any other preservatives, you'll need the following ingredients:

Ingredients:

2 pounds (about 900 grams) of ripe plums
1 1/2 cups (300 grams) of granulated sugar
Instructions:

Wash and pit the plums, then chop them into small pieces.
In a large pot, combine the chopped plums and sugar.
Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the plums break down and the mixture thickens. This can take around 30-40 minutes.
To test if it's ready, place a small amount of the jam on a cold plate. If it sets and wrinkles when you push it with your finger, it's done.
Remove the pot from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
Transfer the plum jam into sterilized jars and seal them. You can sterilize the jars by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes.
Allow the jars to cool completely before storing them in a cool, dark place.
This simple recipe uses sugar as the primary preservative. Make sure to use clean and sterilized jars to prolong the shelf life of your homemade plum jam.

When making plum jam, it's not advisable to add oil to the pot to make it less sticky. Oil will not help with the jam-making process and may actually interfere with the jam's texture and flavor.

To prevent your plum jam from sticking to the pot and ensure a good consistency, you should follow these general steps:

Use a non-stick pot: Start with a clean, non-stick or stainless steel pot to minimize sticking.

Cook on low heat: Maintain a gentle, low heat throughout the cooking process to avoid burning and sticking.

Stir frequently: Stir the plum mixture regularly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. This will also help distribute heat evenly.

Add water if necessary: If you notice your jam is starting to stick or burn, you can add a small amount of water, typically a tablespoon at a time, to the mixture. Stir well and continue cooking until the jam reaches the desired consistency.

Use proper pectin: Ensure you're using the right type and amount of pectin (a natural thickening agent found in fruit) as specified in your jam recipe. This will help achieve the desired thickness without sticking.

Follow a trusted recipe: Always follow a trusted plum jam recipe that provides specific instructions on cooking times and techniques.

By following these guidelines, you can make plum jam that's not overly sticky and has a delicious, jam-like consistency. Adding oil to jam is not a common practice and may result in undesirable changes to the final product.
