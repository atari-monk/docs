Do you think it's healthy? 
ChatGPT
The amount of time spent outside can vary depending on individual circumstances and needs. An hour a day outside can be healthy for many people, as it allows you to get fresh air, sunlight, and some physical activity. However, it's also important to consider other factors like your overall lifestyle, physical activity level, and social interactions. If you have concerns about your health or well-being, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Balancing your time between coding projects, sleep, activities, and taking care of your basic needs like food is crucial for your overall well-being. Getting that one hour outside is a good way to break up your routine and get some fresh air and relaxation. Remember that taking care of your health and well-being should be a priority. You can often find ways to be more productive and efficient with your coding when you're well-rested and taking care of yourself.
