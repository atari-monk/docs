Could you write me how to create low poly blender model for my game character? 

ChatGPT
Creating a low-poly Blender model for a game character can be done in a few simple steps:

Modeling:

Start with a basic shape, like a cube or cylinder, to represent the character's body.
Use basic modeling tools (such as extrude, scale, and loop cuts) to shape the character's features. Keep the polygon count low by not adding unnecessary details.
Keep It Simple:

Avoid complex shapes and intricate details.
Use as few vertices as possible to define the character's form.
Edge Loops:

Create efficient edge loops to define the character's major features (e.g., head, torso, limbs).
These loops should flow smoothly without unnecessary subdivisions.
Symmetry:

Work on one side of the character and use a mirror modifier to create symmetry.
Texture Mapping:

Create a simple UV map by unwrapping the model's geometry.
Keep UV islands simple and well-organized.
Materials:

Apply basic materials to your model.
Avoid complex shaders or PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials.
Rigging and Animation:

Keep the rig simple and use as few bones as needed for animation.
Animate with basic keyframes and poses.
Optimization:

Remove any hidden or unnecessary geometry.
Use a decimate modifier to reduce polygon count while preserving the overall shape.
Exporting:

Export your model to the appropriate format for your game engine, such as FBX or OBJ.
Testing:

Import your character into your game engine and test its performance.
Adjust the level of detail as needed to maintain good performance.
Remember, the key to low-poly modeling is simplicity. Focus on the essential features and maintain a clean, efficient mesh.
