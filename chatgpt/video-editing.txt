ChatGPT
Yes, you can cut a piece of an MP4 video without re-encoding it by using a simple tool like FFmpeg. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Download FFmpeg: If you don't already have FFmpeg installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

Open a Command Prompt or Terminal: To use FFmpeg, you'll need to open a command prompt or terminal window.

Run the Command: Use the following command to cut a portion from the source video file (input.mp4) and save it as the output video file (output.mp4):

css
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss START_TIME -t DURATION -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
input.mp4 is the name of your source video file.
START_TIME is the starting time of the cut, specified in HH:MM:SS or seconds.
DURATION is the length of the cut, specified in seconds.
-c:v copy and -c:a copy are used to copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding, which makes the process faster and doesn't consume much CPU.
Replace input.mp4, START_TIME, DURATION, and output.mp4 with your specific file names and time values.

Here's an example command that cuts a 30-second segment starting from 1 minute into the video:

bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:01:00 -t 30 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
This method will quickly cut the desired portion from the video without re-encoding, which saves time and CPU usage.

Please note that FFmpeg is a powerful and flexible tool, and there are many more options available for more advanced video editing if needed.

ChatGPT
To cut a 3-minute segment from a video that starts at 25 minutes and 32 seconds, you can use the following FFmpeg command:

bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 00:25:32 -t 00:03:00 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
Here's what each part of the command does:

input.mp4: Replace this with the name of your source video file.
-ss 00:25:32: Specifies the starting time in HH:MM:SS.
-t 00:03:00: Specifies the duration of the cut, which is 3 minutes.
-c:v copy and -c:a copy: These options copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding, ensuring a fast process.
Make sure to replace input.mp4 with the actual filename of your video, and the output will be saved as output.mp4.

I see, you want to remove the 3-minute segment from the original video. To achieve this, you can use the concat filter in FFmpeg to exclude the specified portion. Here's the command:

bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]trim=duration=1532[s1];[0:v]trim=start=1532[s2];[0:a]atrim=duration=1532[a1];[0:a]atrim=start=1532[a2];[s1][a1][s2][a2]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[outv][outa]" -map "[outv]" -map "[outa]" output.mp4
In this command:

input.mp4: Replace this with the name of your source video file.
The filter_complex option does the following:

[0:v]trim=duration=1532[s1]: Trims the video to the first 25 minutes and 32 seconds.

[0:v]trim=start=1532[s2]: Trims the video to start at 25 minutes and 32 seconds (3 minutes into the video).

[0:a]atrim=duration=1532[a1]: Trims the audio to the first 25 minutes and 32 seconds.

[0:a]atrim=start=1532[a2]: Trims the audio to start at 25 minutes and 32 seconds.

[s1][a1][s2][a2]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[outv][outa]: Concatenates the trimmed video and audio back together.

The -map "[outv]" -map "[outa]" options specify that you want to use the concatenated video and audio streams for the output.

This command will create a new video file named output.mp4 with the 3-minute segment removed.
